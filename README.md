# sudokuSolver
This is a sudoku solver I made during my time at the first U.S Piscine for 42 US. I had spent 3 solid weeks learning C before I made this.

HOW TO USE:

This Sudoku Solver is meant for a 9x9 Puzzle.

1.) Compile all files

2.) Find a sudoku puzzle

3.) For all blank spaces in the puzzle use a dot. Also spaces for line breaks

4.) Call the executable with the inputs from the puzzle. (./a.out etc....)

5.) If the puzzle has two solutions or is insolvable the program will return Error

EXAMPLE:

For this puzzle http://news.nd.edu/assets/80986/sudoku300.jpg

The input would be (./a.out 8..4.6..7 ......4.. .1....65. 5.9.3.78. ....7.... .48.2.1.3 .52....9. ..1...... 3..9.2..5)
